_The Internet Crime Wave_

The Internet has facilitated the greatest organized crime wave since Prohibition 
([USA, 1920-23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States)). Problematically, 
most cybercriminals and industrial spies are overseas, beyond the reach of US or Western 
law enforcement. Many are quietly supported by their national governments. 
For the foreseeable future, this wave will worsen.

One of the most devastating weapons in the cybercriminal's arsenal is an Internet application 
which people willingly use every day, e-mail. It allows criminals to...

1. Send you messages apparently from someone else
2. Send you any content on first contact, including:  
   a) links to hostile websites masquerading as trusted ones  
   b) executable programs, i.e. malware  
   c) attractively-designed disinformation and scam offers  
3. Send you unlimited messages
4. Steal all your past correspondence by discovering a simple password
5. Steal all your organization's correspondence by breaking into a single server

E-mail originated when the only people on the Internet were friendly researchers 
in academia and government. It cannot cope with the 21st Century.

_Safer Modern Messaging..._

Every organization, whether tiny or enormous, needs a members-only messaging service. 
For a small organization, its cost should be negligible. 

To prevent destructive correspondence (in the case of an organization with non-restrictive membership) 
members with whom you are not acquainted must be prevented from sending you arbitrary content. 

To prevent theft of correspondence in the event of compromised accounts or servers, the messaging service 
must store only messages which have not yet been delivered or returned as undeliverable.

The messaging service must reliably deliver each message to every one of your devices that runs a messaging app, 
e.g. laptop, mobile phone, tablet, smartwatch. 
If one of your messaging devices is lost or stolen, you must be able to bar it from further access to your 
messaging accounts. A compromised device must not be able to hijack your accounts. 

The messaging app on your devices must keep track of any number of messaging services to which you belong. 
The app must transfer your message history in a peer-to-peer manner to new devices which you setup for messaging. 
The app should encrypt your message history on local storage. 
The app should automatically backup your message history to secondary local storage when available, 
e.g. a flash drive or microSD card. 
The app should run on any computing device you own.
For sensitive business data which cannot transit a network unencrypted, the app 
should allow encryption prior to send and decryption on receipt, using public or shared keys.
